💬 Sentiment Analysis

The **Sentiment Analysis** project is a web-based application that analyzes the sentiment of user-provided text — classifying it as **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and a trained machine learning model to provide accurate, real-time sentiment predictions through a simple interface.
